Recreating Vera Molnar's 'Lent mouvement blue, orange, rouge et noir', 1955.

Lent mouvement bleu, orange, rouge et noir, 1955, by Vera Molnar consists of 4 different colored circles in a 8 x 8 grid.  I wanted to capture Molnar's sensibilities in her selection and composition of the colors, and I chose to assign specific color on each geometry within the grid.  The code was created using an array, designating and assigning each ellipse/circle with the colors through .shift() function.
